This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

To install all the dependencies and packages, type in terminal:

```bash
bun install
```
then run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

For styling, we are using Tailwind CSS: [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/).

To animate our 3D map we are using Three.js and React Fiber:
- [Three.js docs](https://threejs.org/docs/)
- [Fiber docs](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
